For this weeks TidyTuesday, I explore data from the [Great American Beer Festival](https://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/the-competition/winners/). The Great American Beer Festival is a professionally judged competition that awards gold, silver or bronze medals that are recognized around the world as symbols of brewing excellence.

This week I explore the [{sf}](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html) package by Edzer Pebesma and the [{ggbump}](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggbump) package by David Sjoberg. The {sf}, simple feature, package is a package that helps computer understand the *spatial* geometry of objects in the real world. There is much more detail that can be given regarding this package and its underpinnings but that would be a bit much to talk about. Also I do not quite understand it all but if you are interested I would encourage you to check out the [documentation page](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html). The {ggbump} is a package that extends ggplot2 functions and allows you to create bump charts. You may wonder what is a bump chart? Well according to the internet 😅, a bump chart is a graphic that is "used to compare two dimensions against each other using one of the measure values"^[Bump chart : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tableau/tableau_bump_chart.htm] with it most often being used to visualize rankings. *With those two packages in mind, I utilize features from both packages to make a graphic that shows the top 10 gold medals by state*
